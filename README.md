This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks designed to pull and analyze data from the Government of Canada's Elgg instance, GCconnex.  

The scripts contain SQLalchemy DB queries, tranformations and visualizations that may be applicable to other Elgg DB analysis as well.

Requirements: Anaconda's latest distribution is recommended.  Some notebooks have separate dependencies for visualization.
